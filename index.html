        <h2 id="headline"><u>Here's a glimpse of Sushant Singh Rajput's life:</u></h2>

        <ul>
          <h1><u>Birth, Life and Education</u></h1><br>
           <p>Sushant Singh Rajput was born on January 21, 1986, to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh, in Purnia, Bihar. He did his schooling at St. Karen's High School in Patna and then at Kulachi Hansraj Model School in New Delhi.

           <p>In 2002, he lost his mother and his entire family moved from Patna to Delhi.  One of his sisters, Mitu Singh is a state-level cricketer. <br> <br>
          <p> In 2003, he secured the seventh rank in the Delhi College of Engineering Entrance Exam and got admitted in B.E. Mechanical Engineering.

He drops out of college to pursue his acting career. </p><br>
          
          <h1><u>Death and Personal Life</u></h1><br>
          <p>Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on June 14, 2020, after hanging himself in his apartment in Mumbai. In 2015, Sushant's ex-girlfriend Ankita Lokhande publicly slapped him when he was completely drunk and was dancing with other girls at a party. The couple broke up in 2016 after being in a relationship for 6 years. Sushant was rumoured to have been secretly married to Ankita in the year 2015.</p><br>
          
          <h1> <u>Investigation in Death Case</u></h1><br>
           <p>After the FIR filed by Sushant's father against actress Rhea Chakraborty, the actress moved to the Supreme Court and a CBI probe was ordered by the apex court in the case. <br>

            <br> Upon the request of BJP MP Subramanian Swamy for an update on the case in December 2020, the CBI stated that they haven't reached a conclusion and the case is still being investigated.<br>  
            
           <br>  The CBI stated that they have carried out a thorough investigation in the case using the latest scientific techniques. The CBI officials associated with the case visited Aligarh, Faridabad, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Manesar and Patna to collect evidence and record statements amid the investigation. <br>
            
           <br> The CBI further mentioned that the simulation exercise was also carried out by the experts to get a better idea of the circumstances related to his death. <br>
            
           <br> Doctors at Cooper Hospital were also questioned by the CBI amid the investigation who performed an autopsy on Sushant Singh Rajput. The late actor was rushed to Cooper Hospital, Mumbai after he was found dead and the autopsy was conducted by the doctors post-sunset. <br>
            
           <br> Earlier, Mumbai Police on the basis of medical statements, declared the actor's death as a case of suicide and initially registered Accidental Death Report (ADR) and began investigating it with a suicide angle. A similar investigation was carried out by the Bihar Police upon his father's FIR. <br>
            
            <br> However, both the investigations were stopped when the case was transferred to CBI in the month of August 2020. <br>
            
            <br> AIIMS panel headed by Dr. Sudhir Gupta ruled out any foul play in the case but CBI is yet to declare if it was a murder or suicide. <br>
            
           <br>  NCB and ED also probed the case on the drug and money laundering angle. On 8 September 2020, NCB arrested actress Rhea Chakraborty who stayed in Byculla Jail, Mumbai for almost a month and is currently out on bail. </p> <br>
